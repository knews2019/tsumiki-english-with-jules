# 5.3 Continuous Improvement and Prompt Optimization

## Introduction

The success of AITDD cannot be achieved with a one-time prompt design. By optimizing prompts through a continuous improvement cycle and accumulating organizational knowledge, you can achieve stable, high-quality development. In this chapter, we will learn systematic improvement methods and practical optimization techniques.

## Designing the Improvement Cycle

### The Basic Improvement Cycle

```
Plan â†’ Do â†’ Check â†’ Act â†’ Plan...
```

**The PDCA Cycle in AITDD:**

**Plan:**
- Set improvement goals for prompts
- Define evaluation metrics
- Identify the target for improvement

**Do:**
- Execute with the revised prompt
- Implement data collection
- Record the results

**Check:**
- Measure the output quality
- Evaluate efficiency
- Analyze problems

**Act:**
- Correct the prompt
- Update best practices
- Document the knowledge

### Areas for Improvement

**1. Prompt Structure and Content**
- Clarity of instructions
- Appropriateness of constraints
- Effectiveness of examples

**2. Output Quality**
- Accuracy of the code
- Accuracy of the traffic light classification
- Appropriateness of TODO items

**3. Efficiency**
- Reduction of execution time

- Improved maintainability
- Ensured extensibility

### How to Collect Evaluation Data

**Automatic Collection:**
```bash
# Script for collecting prompt execution logs
cat > scripts/collect-metrics.sh << 'EOF'
#!/bin/bash

# Record execution time
echo "$(date): Starting prompt execution" >> logs/execution.log
start_time=$(date +%s)

# Execute prompt
$1

# Record end time
end_time=$(date +%s)
duration=$((end_time - start_time))
echo "$(date): Execution completed in ${duration}s" >> logs/execution.log

# Collect quality metrics
npm test -- --reporter=json > logs/test-results.json
eslint src/ --format=json > logs/lint-results.json
EOF
```

**Manual Collection:**
```markdown
## Weekly Retrospective Template

**Number of prompts executed:** [Number]
**Success rate:** [Percentage]
**Major problems:**
- [Problem 1]
- [Problem 2]

**Points for improvement:**
- [Improvement point 1]
- [Improvement point 2]

**What went well:**
- [Success point 1]
- [Success point 2]
```

## How to Evaluate Prompts

### Multi-faceted Evaluation of Output Quality

**1. Functional Accuracy Evaluation**
```javascript
// Example of evaluation items
const evaluationCriteria = {
  functionality: {
    requirements_coverage: 0.95,    // Requirements coverage
    edge_case_handling: 0.85,       // Edge case handling
    error_handling: 0.90            // Error handling
  },
  code_quality: {
    readability: 0.88,              // Readability
    maintainability: 0.85,          // Maintainability
    performance: 0.80               // Performance
  },
  inference_accuracy: {
    green_precision: 0.92,          // Precision of ðŸŸ¢
    yellow_recall: 0.88,            // Recall of ðŸŸ¡
    red_detection: 0.95             // Detection rate of ðŸ”´
  }
};
```

```

## Discovering Issues Through Log Analysis

### Systematic Analysis of Execution Logs

**Log Collection Items:**
```json
{
  "timestamp": "2025-06-21T10:30:00Z",
  "prompt_type": "test_generation",
  "execution_time": 45,
  "success": true,
  "output_quality": {
    "test_count": 12,
    "coverage": 0.85,
    "error_count": 2
  },
  "inference_classification": {
    "green_count": 8,
    "yellow_count": 3,
    "red_count": 1
  },
  "issues": [
    "The organization-specific log format is unclear",
    "Inference of the error handling pattern"
  ]
}
```

**Example of an Analysis Pattern:**
```python
# Example of a log analysis script
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Load log data
df = pd.read_json('logs/execution_log.json', lines=True)

# Analyze success rate
success_rate = df.groupby('prompt_type')['success'].mean()
print("Success rate by prompt type:")
print(success_rate)

# Analyze execution time
execution_time_stats = df.groupby('prompt_type')['execution_time'].describe()
print("Execution time statistics:")
print(execution_time_stats)

# Analyze issue patterns
issues_flat = [issue for issues in df['issues'] for issue in issues]
issue_counts = pd.Series(issues_flat).value_counts()
print("Frequently occurring issue patterns:")
print(issue_counts.head(10))
```

### Identifying Issue Patterns

**Typical Issue Patterns:**
```markdown
## Issue Analysis Results

**High-frequency issues (3+ times/week):**
1. Inference of organization-specific policies (overlooking ðŸ”´ classification)
2. Inconsistent error message formats
3. Lack of realism in test data

// Automatic quality measurement script
const fs = require('fs');
const { execSync } = require('child_process');

class QualityMetrics {
  constructor(projectPath) {
    this.projectPath = projectPath;
  }

  async collectMetrics() {
    const metrics = {
      timestamp: new Date().toISOString(),
      test_results: this.getTestResults(),
      code_quality: this.getCodeQuality(),
      inference_analysis: this.getInferenceAnalysis()
    };

    return metrics;
  }

  getTestResults() {
    try {
      const result = execSync('npm test -- --reporter=json', {
        cwd: this.projectPath
      });
      const testData = JSON.parse(result.toString());

      return {
        total_tests: testData.stats.tests,
        passed: testData.stats.passes,
        failed: testData.stats.failures,
        success_rate: testData.stats.passes / testData.stats.tests
      };
    } catch (error) {
      return { error: error.message };
    }
  }

  getCodeQuality() {
    try {
      const lintResult = execSync('eslint src/ --format=json', {
        cwd: this.projectPath
      });
      const lintData = JSON.parse(lintResult.toString());

      return {
        error_count: lintData.reduce((sum, file) => sum + file.errorCount, 0),
        warning_count: lintData.reduce((sum, file) => sum + file.warningCount, 0)
      };
    } catch (error) {
      return { error: error.message };
    }
  }

  getInferenceAnalysis() {
    // Automation of TODO analysis
    const todoFiles = this.findTodoFiles();
    let greenCount = 0, yellowCount = 0, redCount = 0;

    todoFiles.forEach(file => {
      const content = fs.readFileSync(file, 'utf8');
      greenCount += (content.match(/ðŸŸ¢/g) || []).length;
      yellowCount += (content.match(/ðŸŸ¡/g) || []).length;
      redCount += (content.match(/ðŸ”´/g) || []).length;
    });

    return { greenCount, yellowCount, redCount };
  }
}
```

**Automatic Generation of Improvement Proposals:**
```python
# Automatic improvement proposal generation system
import pandas as pd
from datetime import datetime, timedelta

class ImprovementSuggester:
    def __init__(self, metrics_data):
        self.df = pd.DataFrame(metrics_data)

    def analyze_trends(self):
        """Improvement proposals based on trend analysis"""
        suggestions = []

        # Detect a downward trend in success rate
        recent_success = self.df.tail(7)['success_rate'].mean()
        overall_success = self.df['success_rate'].mean()

        if recent_success < overall_success * 0.9:
            suggestions.append({
                'priority': 'high',
                'issue': 'Decreasing success rate',
                'suggestion': 'Review prompts and reconfirm quality standards'
            })

        # Detect an upward trend in execution time
        recent_time = self.df.tail(7)['execution_time'].mean()
        overall_time = self.df['execution_time'].mean()

        if recent_time > overall_time * 1.2:
            suggestions.append({
                'priority': 'medium',
                'issue': 'Increasing execution time',
                'suggestion': 'Consider simplifying prompts or dividing tasks'
            })

        return suggestions
```
