# 6.3 Reviews and Quality Control

Quality control in AITDD requires a significantly different approach from traditional development methods. By understanding the characteristics of AI-generated code and appropriately utilizing human judgment, you can efficiently develop high-quality software. This section explains in detail the practical methods for effective reviews and quality control in an AITDD environment.

## The Uniqueness of AI Code Reviews

### Characteristics of AI-generated Code

AI-generated code has the following unique characteristics, which require special attention during reviews:

#### The Illusion of Completeness
- **Challenge**: Everything written by the AI looks complete.
- **Risk**: The danger of passing the review without much thought.
- **Countermeasure**: Intentionally conduct reviews from a critical perspective.

#### Tendency for Over-implementation
- **Characteristic**: The AI generates a **large amount of uninstructed code** on its own.
- **Problem**: Addition of unrequested features.
- **Impact**: Increased system complexity and reduced maintainability.

#### Lack of Consistency
- **Completely different implementations** are likely to be born from the same request.
- A tendency to ignore existing code styles.
- Lack of a sense of unity in the entire system.

### Differences from Traditional Reviews

```markdown
# Comparison of Review Perspectives

## Traditional Code Review
- Validity of the implementation method
- Compliance with coding standards
- Presence of bugs
- Maintainability/readability

## AI Code Review (Additional Perspectives)
- Presence of uninstructed implementation ★Important
- Consistency with existing code
- Validity of the AI's judgment basis
- Confirmation of excessive feature addition
```

## Review Points and Checklist Items

### 1. Instruction Compliance Check

The most important review point is to check **"if it has written something that was not instructed"**:

#### Specific Checklist Items
```markdown
# Instruction Compliance Checklist

## Functional Scope
□ Are only the requested features implemented?
□ Have no extra features been added?
□ Does it include judgment logic not in the specifications?

## Implementation Method
□ Does it follow the specified implementation policy?
□ Does it use any prohibited technologies or methods?
□ Does it deviate from existing patterns?

## Data Structure
□ Does it use the specified data format?
□ Has the schema been changed without permission?
□ Have no unnecessary fields been added?
```

#### Practical Review Method
```markdown
# Practical Review Example

## Original Instruction
"Implement a user search feature by username."

## Reviewing the AI's Implementation
✓ Good Example: Simple search by username only
✗ Bad Example: Also implements search by email, phone number, and partial match

## Example Review Comment
"Partial match search is not in the requirements this time.
 Please correct it to be a full match of the username only."
```

### 2. Consistency Check with the Existing System

Confirm whether the AI-generated code can be properly integrated with the existing system:

#### Architectural Consistency
- Consistency with existing design patterns
- Adherence to the layer structure
- Appropriateness of dependencies

#### Code Style Unification
- Unification of naming conventions
- Consistency of formatting
- Unification of comment styles

### 3. Quality Improvement by Confirming the Basis

Conduct quality checks utilizing the AI itself:

#### Basis Confirmation Process
```markdown
# Procedure for AI Basis Confirmation

## Step 1: Conduct Basis Confirmation
"Is there a basis for this implementation? Please tell me the parts that are not explicitly stated in the specification."

## Step 2: Judgment based on the AI's answer
### Pattern A: The AI answers "there is no basis"
→ A human judges whether to accept it.
→ If not accepted, change the instruction and rerun.

### Pattern B: The AI shows the basis
→ A human evaluates the validity of the basis.
→ Give correction instructions as needed.
```

#### Practical Example of Basis Confirmation
```markdown
# Practical Example of Basis Confirmation

## Reviewer's Question
"Why did you implement a caching feature here?"

## AI's Example Answer 1 (With basis)
"Because it was specified in the performance requirements that 'search must be within 0.5 seconds,'
 I judged that caching frequently accessed data was necessary."
→ The basis is clear, so it is accepted.

## AI's Example Answer 2 (Without basis)
"I added it as a general best practice.
 There was no clear requirement specification."
→ Consider deleting it because it is not in the requirements.
```

## Quality Control at Each Step of TDD

### Quality Check in the Red Step

Ensuring quality at the test case creation stage:

#### Clarity of Test Requirements
- Is the purpose of the test clearly defined?
- Are the expected values set concretely?
- Are edge cases covered appropriately?

#### Independence of Tests
- Does it not depend on other tests?
- Does it not depend on the test execution order?
- Does it not depend on the external state?

### Implementation Quality Check in the Green Step

Key review items at the implementation stage:

```markdown
# Green Step Quality Checklist

## Appropriateness of Implementation
□ Is it the minimum necessary implementation to pass the tests?
□ Is it not over-engineered?
□ Does it not consider future expansion too much?

## Code Quality
□ Does it follow the existing coding standards?
□ Is appropriate exception handling implemented?
□ Is log output set up appropriately?

## Performance
□ Does it not include unnecessary processing?
□ Is database access optimized?
□ Is memory usage appropriate?
```

### Quality Improvement in the Refactor Step

Confirmation of quality improvement at the refactoring stage:

#### Improved Design Quality
- Has the readability of the code improved?
- Has duplicate code been deleted?
- Is the separation of responsibilities done appropriately?

#### Ensuring Maintainability
- Does it have a structure that is easy to change?
- Are the tests not broken?
- Is the documentation updated?

### Comprehensive Quality Check in the Validation Step

In the Validation step, the following comprehensive quality checks are performed:

#### Confirmation of Functional Requirement Fulfillment
1.  **Confirmation of the correctness of test case implementation**
    -   Are the initially planned test cases implemented correctly?
    -   Is the test content as per the specifications?

2.  **Confirmation of regression of existing test cases**
    -   Have the new changes not broken existing test cases?
    -   Is the consistency of the entire system maintained?

3.  **Source code quality check**
    -   Verification of the quality of the modified source code.
    -   Confirmation of coding standards, maintainability, and readability.

## Quality Control Strategy in Team Development

### Changes in the Review Process

In AITDD, the role of the developer changes from "creating" to "confirming," so the review process also needs to adapt:

#### New Review Flow
```markdown
# AITDD-compatible Review Flow

## 1. Preliminary Check of AI Implementation
- First check by the implementer
- Confirmation of instruction compliance
- Correction of obvious problems

## 2. Peer Review
- Objective review by other developers
- Confirmation of design validity
- Architectural consistency check

## 3. AI Basis Confirmation Review
- Confirm the implementation basis with the AI
- Clarification of inferred parts
- Identification of uncertain judgments

## 4. Approval & Merge
- Final quality judgment
- Risk assessment and release judgment
```

### Quality Control in Parallel Development

Quality control when executing multiple Claude Code sessions in parallel:

#### Quality Control Utilizing `git worktree`
```markdown
# Parallel Development Quality Control

## Branching Strategy
- Each session works on an independent branch.
- Regular synchronization with the main branch.
- Quality check when resolving conflicts.

## Ensuring Quality During Integration
- Comprehensive test execution before branch integration.
- Confirmation of mutual dependencies.
- Confirmation of the operation of the entire system.
```

#### Quality Improvement Through Information Sharing
- Progress management based on GitHub issues.
- Sharing and agreement on implementation policies.
- Early detection and handling of quality problems.

          # Check complexity
          npx complexity-report --format json src/

          # Check security
          npm audit

      - name: AI implementation verification
        run: |
          # Check for uninstructed implementation with a custom script
          node scripts/check-ai-implementation.js
```

### Utilizing Static Analysis Tools

```markdown
# Static Analysis Specialized for AI-generated Code

## Checklist Items
- Unused import statements (AI tends to add them on its own)
- Abnormal complexity values (detection of over-implementation)
- Violation of naming conventions (inconsistency with existing patterns)
- Security vulnerabilities (problems due to AI's lack of knowledge)

## Example Tools
- ESLint (custom rules)
- SonarQube (quality gate settings)
- CodeClimate (technical debt monitoring)
- Snyk (security scanning)
```

## Success Stories in Quality Control

### Practical Examples of Improvement

```markdown
