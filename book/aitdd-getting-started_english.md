# Introduction to AITDD - Understand AI-Assisted Test-Driven Development in 10 Minutes

## What is AITDD?

AITDD (AI + Test-Driven Development) is a new development methodology that streamlines Test-Driven Development using AI. By combining the power of AI with traditional TDD, you can dramatically increase development speed while creating high-quality software.

## How It Differs from Traditional Development

### Traditional Development
- Writing code line by line manually
- Consuming a lot of time for implementation
- Highly dependent on individual skills

### AITDD
- AI assists with code generation
- Implementation burden is significantly reduced
- High-speed development while ensuring quality with tests

## The Basic Flow of AITDD

1.  **Create TODOs** - Clarify what to build
2.  **Define Specifications** - Decide on the details with AI
3.  **Write Tests** - Express the expected behavior with tests
4.  **Implement** - Have the AI generate the code
5.  **Verify** - A human performs the final check

By repeating this flow, you can efficiently build software that works reliably.

## What Kind of Projects Is It Suited For?

### Especially Effective
- **Projects that require writing a lot of similar code**
  - CRUD operations
  - API development
  - Form validation
- **JavaScript & Python** projects
  - Easier for AI to look up library information

### Caution Required
- When extremely high performance is required
- For compiled languages like Java and C# (effectiveness is limited)

## Tools to Use

### Claude Sonnet 4
- The main AI assistant
- Handles everything from code generation to quality checks
- The key is how you write the prompts (instructions)

### Development Environment
- Your usual editor/IDE
- Test execution environment
- Version control (Git)

## A Real Development Example

### Example: A Simple Task Management Feature

1.  **TODO**: "Create a feature to add, delete, and change the completion status of tasks."

2.  **Define Specifications**: Decide on details while conversing with the AI
    - Task data structure
    - Required API endpoints
    - Error handling

3.  **Write Tests**: Express the expected behavior in test code.

4.  **Implement**: The AI generates code that passes the tests.

5.  **Verify**: Check the functionality and quality.

## Benefits

- **Development Speed**: Can develop several times faster than traditional methods
- **Stable Quality**: Quality assurance through tests
- **Learning Effect**: Learn new technologies from AI-generated code
- **Creativity**: Reduce implementation work and focus on design

## Points to Note

- **Don't rely entirely on AI**: The final decisions are made by humans
- **Prompt Design**: The quality changes depending on how you instruct the AI
- **Continuous Improvement**: Improve the process through practice

## 3 Steps to Get Started

### Step 1: Prepare Your Environment
- Get a Claude Sonnet 4 account
- Set up your development environment

### Step 2: Start Small
- Begin with simple CRUD operations
- Practice writing prompts

### Step 3: Continuous Improvement
- Improve the process through practice
- Share knowledge within the team

## Summary

AITDD is a method for efficiently developing high-quality software with the help of AI. It's not about letting the AI take over completely, but about humans and AI collaborating to achieve a level of speed and quality that was previously unimaginable.

Try starting with a small project to experience the benefits of AITDD for yourself. Through practice, you should be able to discover your own AITDD style.
