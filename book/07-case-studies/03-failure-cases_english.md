# 7.3 Failure Cases and Countermeasures

## Overview

This section explains in detail the specific failure cases encountered in the practice of AITDD and the countermeasures learned from them. These cases are problems that occurred in an actual development environment and can be used as a practical guide to avoid similar failures.

## Major Failure Categories

### 1. Problem of Over-reliance on AI

#### Failure Case: Abdication of Decision-making

**Situation**
- As a result of continuing to accept the AI's proposals as they were, the developer's own intentions and thoughts were no longer reflected.
- Too much design judgment was left to the AI, and project-specific requirements were ignored.
- The opportunity to think of creative solutions was lost, and only uniform implementations were produced.

**Specific Problems**
- The business logic was too generic and did not meet the actual requirements.
- Adoption of a common architecture with no originality.
- A decrease in technical discussions within the team.
- Loss of skill improvement opportunities for developers.

**Scope of Impact**
- **Decline in design quality**: A generic design that does not conform to the requirements.
- **Restriction of creativity**: Original ideas and solutions are not born.
- **Decrease in learning opportunities**: A decrease in opportunities to think for oneself.
- **Decline in team strength**: A decrease in technical discussions and knowledge sharing.

#### Countermeasure: Intentional Restriction of AI Utilization

**1. Clarification of the Decision-making Process**
```
Decision-making flow:
Human decides on the policy â†’ Request implementation from AI â†’ Verify the result â†’ Human makes the judgment
```

**2. Mechanism for Protecting Creativity**
- Humans always consider multiple plans at the design stage.
- Treat the AI's proposal as "one of the reference plans."
- Do not use AI for parts where originality is important.

**3. Practice for Maintaining Skills**
- Periodically create opportunities for manual implementation.
- A habit of explaining the design reasons in code reviews.
- Technical research is conducted under human leadership.

### 2. Quality Problems Due to Unintended Implementations

#### Failure Case: Uncontrollable Code Generation

**Situation**
- Although I thought I had given clear instructions, the AI executed an unexpectedly large-scale correction.
- An implementation was generated that ignored consistency with existing code.
- Features that significantly exceeded the scope of the instructions were added without permission.

**Specific Problems**
- **Unintended modification of existing code**: Even unrelated files are changed.
- **Implementation based on excessive inference**: Addition of unrequested features.
- **Discrepancy with design intent**: Implementation that differs from the architectural policy.
- **Occurrence of side effects**: Unexpected changes in behavior.

**Actual Case**
```
Instruction: "Add a user registration feature"
Expectation: Addition of a registration.js file
Actuality: The existing auth.js, user.js, and database.js were also significantly modified.
Result: The entire authentication system was unintentionally changed.
```

#### Countermeasure: Control by Advance Assumption

**1. Clear Assumption Setting Before Implementation**
```
Checklist before requesting implementation:
â–¡ Clarification of the files to be changed
â–¡ Explanation of the expected implementation pattern
â–¡ Explicitly stating the parts that should not be changed
â–¡ Clearly specifying the boundaries of the implementation scope
```

**2. Forcing Phased Implementation**
- Do not request large changes at once.
- Detailed instructions on a file-by-file basis.
- A confirmation and approval process at each stage.

**3. Thorough Confirmation of Differences**
```
Confirmation process:
1. Confirm the list of changed files.
2. Confirm the changes in each file.
3. Discover and deal with unexpected changes.
4. Execute the next stage after approval.
```

### 3. Sharp Increase in Quality Control Costs

#### Failure Case: Review Hell

**Situation**
- It took more time than expected to confirm the quality of the AI-generated code.
- The frequency and load of review work increased sharply.
- The total development time was shortened, but the worker's fatigue increased significantly.

**Specific Problems**
- **Continuous detailed code reviews**: Full confirmation of the large amount of code generated by the AI.
- **Verification load of inferred parts**: Confirmation of the validity of the AI's judgment.
- **Ambiguity of quality standards**: It was unclear what to check and to what extent.
- **Review fatigue**: The risk of oversight due to a decline in concentration.

**Problems in Numbers**
```
Traditional Development:
- Implementation time: 1-2 days
- Review time: 30 min - 1 hour

After Introducing AITDD:
- Implementation time: less than 1 hour
- Review time: 1 hour or more
- Review frequency: 10-20 times increase
```

#### Countermeasure: Improving the Efficiency of Quality Control

**1. Standardization of Review Criteria**

Establish five systematic quality criteria:
```
Quality checkpoints:
1. Test results: All tests are successful.
2. Security: No critical vulnerabilities are found.
3. Performance: No performance issues are found.
4. Refactor quality: The goals are achieved.
5. Code quality: Improved to an appropriate level.
```

**2. Introduction of an AI Inference Visualization System**

Improving efficiency with a traffic light system:
- ðŸŸ¢ Green: Certain parts (light check)
- ðŸŸ¡ Yellow: Inferred parts (check with caution)
- ðŸ”´ Red: Uncertain parts (check with focus)

**3. Dispersing the Review Load**
```
Review strategy:
- Prioritization based on importance
- Identification of parts that can be checked automatically
- Concentration on parts that require human judgment
- A phased review process
```

### 4. Failure of the Test Strategy

#### Failure Case: Flaws in Test Design

**Situation**
- The test cases generated by the AI were insufficient and missed important bugs.
- The comprehensiveness of the test cases was low, and edge cases were not considered.
- Integration tests were insufficient, causing problems with the overall system operation.

**Specific Problems**
- **Happy path only tests**: A bias towards test cases for the normal flow.
- **Lack of error handling**: Insufficient tests for the sad path.
- **Omission of boundary value tests**: Lack of tests at limit values.
- **Lack of consideration for dependencies**: Inadequate tests for the interaction between modules.

#### Countermeasure: Strengthening Test Design

**1. Systematization of Test Case Design**
```
Test case classification:
â–¡ Happy path (normal flow)
â–¡ Sad path (error cases)
â–¡ Boundary values (max, min, NULL, etc.)
â–¡ Integration (interaction between modules)
â–¡ Performance (response time, load)
```

**2. Strengthening Test Reviews**
- Human review of the test cases generated by the AI.
- Systematic check for missing tests.
- Confirmation of consistency with business requirements.

**3. Phased Test Execution**
```
Test execution order:
1. Unit tests (individual confirmation of each feature)
2. Integration tests (confirmation of the interaction between features)
3. System tests (confirmation of the overall operation)
4. Acceptance tests (confirmation of business requirements)
```

### 5. Failure of Prompt Design

#### Failure Case: Discrepancy in the Direction of Improvement

**Situation**
- When I requested the AI to improve a prompt, it was corrected in a completely different direction.
- The result was the opposite of the expected improvement.
- I intended for continuous improvement, but the quality deteriorated.

**Specific Problems**
- **Lack of problem description**: The explanation of the current problem was ambiguous.
- **Unclear direction for improvement**: The desired direction for improvement was not specified.
- **Lack of context sharing**: Insufficient background information on the project.
- **Lack of phased improvement**: Requesting a large change at once.

#### Countermeasure: An Issue-driven Improvement Approach

**1. Clear Problem Description**
```
Problem description template:
Current problem: [Specific description of the problem]
Expected improvement: [What you want it to become]
Constraints: [Parts that should not be changed]
Background information: [Context of the project]
```

**2. A Phased Improvement Process**
- Accumulate small improvements.
- Confirm the effect at each stage.
- Return to the previous stage if there is a problem.

**3. Measuring the Effect of Improvement**
```
Improvement evaluation criteria:
â–¡ Has the original problem been resolved?
â–¡ Have no new problems occurred?
â–¡ Has it improved in the expected direction?
â–¡ Are there no side effects or degradations?
```

## Best Practices for Failure Prevention

### 1. Thorough Advance Preparation

**Pre-implementation Checklist**
```
â–¡ Clarification of requirements (what to build)
â–¡ Specification of constraints (what not to do)
â–¡ Expected deliverables (what kind of result is desired)
â–¡ Quality standards (what level of quality is required)
â–¡ Test strategy (how to confirm)
```

### 2. Phased Approach

**Start small and proceed reliably**
- Do not make large changes at once.
- Confirm and approve at each stage.
- Correct problems immediately.
- Reuse success patterns.

### 3. Continuous Improvement

**A mechanism for learning from failure**
```
Failure analysis process:
1. Detailed record of the problem
2. Analysis of the root cause
3. Consideration and implementation of countermeasures
4. Establishment of recurrence prevention measures
5. Knowledge sharing within the team
```

### 4. Maintaining Balance

**Appropriate division of roles between humans and AI**
- Creative judgment: Led by humans
- Implementation work: Supported by AI
- Quality confirmation: Responsibility of humans
- Continuous improvement: Implemented collaboratively

## Early Detection of Dangerous Signs

### Warning Signs

If the following symptoms appear, improvement is needed immediately:

**Warning Signs in the Development Process**
- A tendency to accept AI output as is has increased.
- The time spent thinking about design has decreased dramatically.
- You have stopped reviewing test cases.
- Code reviews have become a formality.

**Warning Signs in Quality**
- Unexpected bugs occur frequently.
- Corrections often affect other parts.
- You are repeating the same kinds of problems over and over.
- The consistency of the entire system is lost.

**Warning Signs in the Team**
- Technical discussions have decreased.
- The skill gap between individuals is not narrowing.
- New ideas are no longer emerging.
- The degree of dependence on AI has become too high.

### Early Countermeasures

**Measures to be implemented immediately**
1.  Temporarily stop using AI and analyze the root cause of the problem.
2.  Partially revive manual implementation and adjust the balance.
3.  Intentionally increase technical discussions within the team.
4.  Review and improve quality standards and processes.

## Summary

The failures that occur in the practice of AITDD are in many cases preventable. The important things are:

**Principles for Failure Prevention**
1.  **Thorough advance preparation**: Setting clear requirements and constraints.
2.  **Phased approach**: Starting small and proceeding reliably.
3.  **Continuous improvement**: Learning from failure and improving the process.
4.  **Maintaining balance**: Appropriate division of roles between humans and AI.

**The Most Important Lesson**
- Failure is an opportunity for learning.
- Early detection and early response are important.
- Continuous improvement of the process is the key to success.
- Human judgment and creativity are irreplaceable.

Please use these failure cases and countermeasures as a reference to realize a safer and more effective AITDD practice. The path to success is to not be afraid of failure, but to continuously improve so as not to repeat the same failures.
