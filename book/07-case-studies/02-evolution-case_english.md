# 7.2 A Case Study of Evolution from Vibe Coding to TDD

## Introduction

In the evolution of AI-assisted development methods, there is a typical path that many developers experience. This section explains in detail the process of evolution from unstructured AI utilization, called "Vibe Coding," to the systematized AITDD method. This case study provides important lessons in the maturation process of AI development methods.

## What is Vibe Coding?

### Definition and Characteristics

**Vibe Coding** is **"coding with AI based on gut feeling and momentum."** It has the following characteristics:

- A combination of **live coding + AI**
- Unstructured, ad-hoc utilization of AI
- Lack of a clear design phase
- A tendency to accept AI output as is
- A test strategy that is an afterthought

### Initial Appeal

Vibe Coding is very appealing at first:

- **Immediate start of implementation**: You can start working before thinking.
- **High initial efficiency**: Implementation of a single feature is surprisingly fast.
- **Low learning cost**: No need to learn special methods.
- **Intuitive operation**: Code is generated through natural conversation.

### Transition of Tools Used

**Initial Stage (Vibe Coding era)**
- Claude Sonnet 3.5
- DeepSeek R1 distilled model
- Trial and error with various AI tools

## Serious Problems with Vibe Coding

### 1. Unstable Quality

Specific problems encountered in actual development:

**Rapid Increase in Test Load**
- The need to **test everything manually** arises.
- It is difficult to add an automated testing mechanism later.
- It takes a long time to identify the cause when a bug is found.

**Unpredictable Code Generation**
- The AI generates a **large amount of uninstructed code** on its own.
- It starts writing similar code, **ignoring the existing code**.
- **Completely different implementations** are born from the same request.

**Occurrence of Repetitive Work**
- **Bug fixing becomes a repetition of the same thing**.
- A problem that was fixed once recurs in another place.
- The learning effect of debugging patterns does not accumulate.

### 2. Scalability Limitations

**"The Wall of Integrating 3 Features"**

A clear limit that became apparent in practice:

- **Single feature**: Very fast and efficient.
- **Integration of 2 features**: A little difficult but possible.
- **Integration of 3 features**: Suddenly becomes difficult, and it gets to a situation where **manual work is faster**.

**Difficulty of Integration Work**
- Since each feature is generated independently, consistency problems occur during integration.
- Interface mismatches.
- Disconnection of data flow.
- A large amount of duplicate code is generated.

### 3. Fatal Lack of Maintainability

**Inconsistent Code**
- Naming conventions differ for each file.
- Inconsistent architectural patterns.
- Mixed design philosophies for data structures.

**Low Predictability**
- Different results are generated for the same correction request.
- It is difficult to predict side effects.
- It is impossible to grasp the scope of the impact of changes.

**Difficulty of Debugging**
- The root cause of errors is unclear.
- The logging policy is inconsistent.
- Lack of consistency in error handling.

## Dramatic Improvement by Introducing TDD

### Major Problems Solved

**1. Realization of Phased Development**
- Reliable implementation in small functional units.
- Quality assurance at each stage.
- Minimization of problems during integration.

**2. Robust Test Foundation**
- Implementation after **preparing tests thoroughly**.
- Maintaining quality with regression tests.
- Automated test execution.

**3. Support for Long-term Development**
- Achieved stability that can be **used even for long-term development**.
- Significant improvement in maintainability.
- Ensuring extensibility.

**4. Predictability of Quality**
- Consistent quality standards.
- A repeatable process.
- A reliable development cycle.

### Current Method: Red-Green-Refactor-Validation

**Structured Process**
1.  **Red**: Write a failing test.
2.  **Green**: Minimal implementation to make the test pass.
3.  **Refactor**: Improve the quality of the code.
4.  **Validation**: Comprehensive quality confirmation.

**Optimization of AI Utilization**
- Clarifying the role of AI at each stage.
- Automation of quality control.
- A continuous improvement process.

## Practical Migration Strategy

### What to Do

1.  **Consider the test strategy from the beginning**
    -   Be conscious of tests even at the Vibe Coding stage.
    -   Introduce an automated testing mechanism early on.
    -   Clarify quality standards.

2.  **Grasp the limitations with small-scale experiments**
    -   Intentionally try complex integrations.
    -   Record and analyze problems.
    -   Clarify the limit points.

3.  **Consider combining with TDD early on**
    -   Introduce TDD as soon as you feel the limits of Vibe Coding.
    -   Minimize the learning cost with a phased migration.
    -   Practice with new development rather than improving existing code.

### What to Avoid

1.  **Large-scale development with Vibe Coding**
    -   Avoid integrating more than 3 features.
    -   Refrain from experimenting on important products.
    -   It is dangerous to apply it to projects with tight deadlines.

2.  **Postponing quality control**
    -   "I'll write tests later" is difficult to realize.
    -   The accumulation of quality problems increases exponentially.
    -   The cost of refactoring increases sharply.

3.  **Uncritically accepting AI output**
    -   Understanding the generated code is essential.
    -   Confirmation of consistency with the design intent.
    -   Verification of security and performance.

## Important Lessons Learned

### Maturing in AITDD Requires Phases

**Vibe Coding** is by no means a waste. Rather, it is an **important first step** in mastering AI development methods. However, a structured approach is essential for **sustainable development**.

### Early Recognition of Limitations is Important

**The wall of integrating 3 features** is a common limit point that many developers experience. The key to success is to recognize this limit early and migrate to TDD at the right time.

### A Phased Introduction is Effective

A phased improvement is easier to learn and more effective for organizational deployment than a sudden change in method.

## Summary

The evolution from Vibe Coding to AITDD is a typical learning path that many developers go through. By understanding this evolution process, you can more efficiently master AI development methods and establish a sustainable development process.

**Core Lessons**:
- Vibe Coding is valuable as a first step in learning.
- The wall of integrating 3 features is a common limit that will surely be reached.
- Sustainable development is realized by introducing TDD.
- A phased evolution is most effective.
