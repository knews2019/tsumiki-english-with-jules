# 7.1 Results of an Experimental Project

## Overview

As a result of applying the AITDD method to a small-scale experimental project, we achieved a dramatic improvement in efficiency compared to traditional development methods. This section explains in detail the quantitative results and newly discovered challenges.

## Dramatic Improvement in Development Efficiency

### Changes in Implementation Speed

**Traditional Development Method**
- Typical implementation time: 1-2 days (8-16 hours)
- Phased manual implementation process
- Highly dependent on individual skills

**After Introducing AITDD**
- Implementation time for equivalent features: less than 1 hour
- **Efficiency improvement rate: 20 to 48 times improvement**
- Stable results due to a structured process

### Characteristics of the Implementation Process

The AITDD implementation adopted the following characteristic process:

- **Automated Execution**: Sequential execution of each step by a shell script.
- **Simplified Time Management**: No manual time measurement; progressed in a natural flow.
- **Quality-focused**: Operated with quality assurance as the top priority over efficiency.
- **Continuous Iteration**: Reliable execution of the Red-Green-Refactor-Validation cycle.

## Realization of Quality Improvement

### Generation of High-Quality Code

- **Refactoring Process**: Achieved high quality through a systematic refactoring process.
- **Validation Step**: Quality assurance through comprehensive quality control.
- **Test-first**: Robust implementation through advance test design.

### Quality Judgment Criteria

Five quality judgment criteria used in the actual project:

1.  **Test Results**: All tests continue to succeed.
2.  **Security**: No critical vulnerabilities have been discovered.
3.  **Performance**: No critical performance issues have been discovered.
4.  **Refactor Quality**: The goals have been achieved.
5.  **Code Quality**: Improved to an appropriate level.

## Discovery of New Challenges

### Fundamental Change in the Nature of Work

The introduction of AITDD has significantly changed the nature of development work:

**Traditional Work**
- Checking code that you have written yourself and understand.
- Implementation work is the main focus.
- Phased quality improvement.

**Work After AITDD**
- Detailed code review of generated code.
- Confirmation and verification work is the main focus.
- Quality control of AI output is important.

### Increased Quality Control Costs

**New Cost Factors**
- Quality confirmation work for AI-generated code.
- Validity verification of inferred parts.
- Confirmation of the correctness of test cases.
- Confirmation of consistency with design intent.

**Typical Problem Patterns**
- **Unintended modification of existing code**: Independent modifications outside the scope of instructions.
- **Implementation based on excessive inference**: Independent judgment beyond the instructions.
- **Discrepancy with design intent**: Differences between the AI's interpretation and the actual intent.

### Analysis of Workload

**Implementation Workload**: Significantly reduced (1-2 days â†’ less than 1 hour)
**Quality Control Workload**: Significantly increased (increased frequency of detailed reviews)
**Overall Work Time**: About 2 hours (reduced to 1/4 to 1/8 of the traditional time)
**Cognitive Load on the Worker**: Increased fatigue (due to the sharp increase in review frequency)

## Results of Tool Selection

### Effects of Adopting Claude Sonnet 4

**Reason for Selection**
- Superior coding ability compared to other AI tools.
- High quality of the generated code.
- Good compatibility with the AITDD process.

**Actual Effects**
- Stable generation of high-quality code.
- Improved efficiency through integration with the process.
- Realization of a predictable development cycle.

## Key Points for Practice

### Success Factors

1.  **Structured Process**: Reliable execution of Red-Green-Refactor-Validation.
2.  **Emphasis on Quality Control**: An attitude that prioritizes quality over efficiency.
3.  **Appropriate Tool Selection**: Selecting AI tools suitable for the project.
4.  **Continuous Improvement**: Continuous review and optimization of the process.

### Points to Note

1.  **Awareness of Quality Control Costs**: Understand the trade-off between improved efficiency and quality control costs.
2.  **Importance of Review Skills**: The ability to review AI-generated code is important.
3.  **Responding to Changes in the Nature of Work**: The role change from implementer to reviewer.
4.  **Comprehensive Efficiency Evaluation**: Evaluate not just the simple implementation time but the overall development efficiency.

## Future Improvement Directions

### Implemented Improvements

- **AI Inference Visualization System**: Clarification of inferred parts by a traffic light system.
- **Validation Step**: Establishment of a systematic quality confirmation process.

### Improvements Under Consideration

- **Adoption of AI for Reviews**: Partial automation of code review work.
- **Automation of Check Work**: Improving the efficiency of the quality control process.
- **Development of Quality Control Tools**: Reducing the workload with dedicated tools.

## Summary

The results of the AITDD experimental project clearly showed the "light and shadow" of **dramatic improvement in implementation efficiency** (20-48 times) and **new challenges in quality control**. This result teaches us the potential of AI-assisted development and at the same time, the importance of an appropriate quality control strategy.

**Important Lessons Learned**
- AITDD reliably improves development efficiency.
- The increase in quality control costs is an unavoidable new reality.
- The nature of the work changes from "creating" to "confirming."
- A comprehensive efficiency evaluation is important.

Based on these findings, we will aim for further improvement and optimization in the next project.
