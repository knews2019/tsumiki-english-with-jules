#### 2. Eliminating the Prompt Skill Gap
**Current Challenges**:
- "The difference between those who can imagine the AI's response and those who cannot."
- The difficulty of leveling skills in a short period.
- A shortage of instructors for team deployment.

**Improvement Strategy**:
```
Phased Skill Leveling Plan:
