Resolve the test errors.
First, run a task to check all test cases and set the test case errors in a todo.
For each target, perform the following work:
  - Investigate the cause of the test error in detail in a task.
  - Fix it using /tdd-green in a new task.
Finally, check the success rate of the overall tests and report it.
The goal is to increase the number of successful test cases.
NEVER: Skip tests.
NEVER: Delete existing test cases.
