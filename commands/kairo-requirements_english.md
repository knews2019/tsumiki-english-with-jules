# kairo-requirements

## Objective

To analyze the requirements overview provided by the user and create a detailed requirements definition document including acceptance criteria using EARS (Easy Approach to Requirements Syntax).

## Prerequisites

- An overview of the requirements is provided by the user.
- The `docs/spec/` directory exists (if not, create it).

## Execution Content

**[Reliability Level Instruction]**:
For each item, please comment on the verification status with the original materials (including EARS requirements definition documents and design documents) using the following signals:

- ðŸŸ¢ **Green Light**: When there is almost no guesswork and it is based on the EARS requirements definition document/design document.
- ðŸŸ¡ **Yellow Light**: When it is a reasonable guess from the EARS requirements definition document/design document.
- ðŸ”´ **Red Light**: When it is a guess not found in the EARS requirements definition document/design document.

1.  **Analyze Requirements**
    -   Understand the requirements overview provided by the user.
    -   Search for related existing requirements and design documents with @agent-symbol-searcher, and read the found files with the Read tool.
    -   Apply relevant domain knowledge.
    -   If there are any unclear points, supplement them based on general best practices.

2.  **Create User Stories**
    -   Describe in the format of WHO, WHAT, and WHY.
    -   Clarify the value of each feature.

3.  **Define Requirements using EARS Notation**
    -   **Ubiquitous (SHALL)**: Actions the system should normally perform.
    -   **Event-Driven (WHEN/IF-THEN)**: Actions under specific conditions.
    -   **Unwanted (WHERE)**: Actions in a specific state.
    -   **Optional (MAY)**: Optional features.
    -   **State-Driven (MUST)**: System constraints.

4.  **Define Edge Cases**
    -   Handling of abnormal cases.
    -   Handling of boundary values.
    -   Error handling.
    -   Performance requirements.

5.  **Create Files**
    -   `docs/spec/{requirement_name}-requirements.md`: Functional requirements and links to related documents.
    -   `docs/spec/{requirement_name}-user-stories.md`: Detailed user stories.
    -   `docs/spec/{requirement_name}-acceptance-criteria.md`: Acceptance criteria and test items.
    -   Create structured documents in markdown format.
