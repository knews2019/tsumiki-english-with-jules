# direct-verify

## Objective

To perform an operational check and test of the configuration work executed in a DIRECT task. To confirm that the settings have been applied correctly and that the system operates as expected.

## Prerequisites

- `direct-setup.md` has been executed.
- A task ID is provided.
- A record of the configuration work exists.

## Execution Content

**[Important]**: If any compilation or syntax errors are found in the files created by direct-setup, it will automatically attempt to resolve them.

1.  **Confirming the Configuration**
    -   Search for related settings and verification patterns with @agent-symbol-searcher, and read the found files with the Read tool.
    -   Read `docs/implements/{TASK-ID}/setup-report.md` with the Read tool to confirm the results of the configuration work.
    -   Check environment variables.
    -   Check the content of configuration files.
    -   Check the installation status of dependencies.
    -   Check the startup status of services.

2.  **Compilation/Syntax Check**
    -   Check for TypeScript/JavaScript syntax errors (if applicable).
    -   Check the syntax of configuration files (JSON, YAML, etc.).
    -   Check SQL syntax (if applicable).
    -   Resolve minimal compilation errors.

3.  **Executing Operational Tests**
    -   Search for existing test cases and verification scripts with @agent-symbol-searcher, and read the found files with the Read tool.
    -   Basic operational check.
    -   Connection test.
    -   Confirmation of permissions.
    -   Confirmation of error cases.

4.  **Quality Check**
    -   Confirmation of security settings.
    -   Confirmation of performance standards.
    -   Confirmation of logs.

## Output Destination

The confirmation record will be created as the following file in the `docs/implements/{TASK-ID}/` directory:
- `verify-report.md`: Configuration confirmation and operational test record

pool.query('SELECT NOW()', (err, res) => {
  if (err) {
    console.error('Error:', err);
