# kairo-tasks

## Objective

To divide implementation tasks into one-day granularities based on the design document and organize them into one-month phases. To create individual task files for each phase and manage them in an appropriate order considering dependencies.

## Prerequisites

- Design documents exist in `docs/design/{requirement_name}/`.
- The design has been approved by the user (or approval has been skipped).
- The `docs/tasks/` directory exists (if not, create it).

## Execution Content

**[Reliability Level Instruction]**:
For each item, please comment on the verification status with the original materials (including EARS requirements definition documents and design documents) using the following signals:

- ðŸŸ¢ **Green Light**: When there is almost no guesswork and it is based on the EARS requirements definition document/design document.
- ðŸŸ¡ **Yellow Light**: When it is a reasonable guess from the EARS requirements definition document/design document.
- ðŸ”´ **Red Light**: When it is a guess not found in the EARS requirements definition document/design document.

1.  **Analyze Design Documents**
    -   Search for design documents with @agent-symbol-searcher, and read the found files with the Read tool.
    -   Read `docs/design/{requirement_name}/architecture.md` with the Read tool.
    -   Read `docs/design/{requirement_name}/database-schema.sql` with the Read tool.
    -   Read `docs/design/{requirement_name}/api-endpoints.md` with the Read tool.
    -   Read `docs/design/{requirement_name}/interfaces.ts` with the Read tool.
    -   Read `docs/design/{requirement_name}/dataflow.md` with the Read tool.

2.  **Check Existing Task Files**
    -   Search for existing task IDs with @agent-symbol-searcher, and read the found task files with the Read tool.
    -   Read existing `docs/tasks/{requirement_name}-*.md` files with the Read tool.
    -   Extract used task numbers (in TASK-0001 format).
    -   Assign non-duplicate numbers to new tasks.

3.  **Identify Tasks**
    -   Foundation tasks (DB settings, environment construction, etc.)
    -   Backend tasks (API implementation)
    -   Frontend tasks (UI implementation)
    -   Integration tasks (E2E tests, etc.)

4.  **Analyze Dependencies**
    -   Clarify dependencies between tasks.
    -   Identify tasks that can be executed in parallel.
    -   Identify the critical path.

5.  **Detail Tasks**
    Include the following for each task:
    -   Task ID (4-digit number in TASK-0001 format)
    -   Task Name
    -   Task Type (TDD/DIRECT)
        -   **TDD**: Development work such as coding, business logic implementation, UI implementation, test implementation, etc.
        -   **DIRECT**: Preparation work such as environment construction, configuration file creation, documentation creation, build settings, etc.
    -   Link to requirements
    -   Dependent tasks
    -   Implementation details
    -   Unit test requirements
    -   Integration test requirements
    -   UI/UX requirements (if applicable)
        -   Loading state
        -   Error display
        -   Mobile support
        -   Accessibility requirements

6.  **Sequence Tasks**
    -   Determine the execution order based on dependencies.
    -   Set milestones.
    -   Group tasks that can be executed in parallel.

7.  **Phase Division and File Creation**
    -   Divide tasks into phases of about one month.
    -   Create individual task files for each phase.
    -   `docs/tasks/{requirement_name}-overview.md`: Overall overview and phase list
    -   `docs/tasks/{requirement_name}-phase1.md`: Detailed tasks for Phase 1
    -   `docs/tasks/{requirement_name}-phase2.md`: Detailed tasks for Phase 2
    -   (Continue according to the number of phases)
    -   Design each task in one-day granularities.
    -   Add a checkbox to each task to make the task completion status trackable.

## Subtask Template

### For TDD Tasks

Each task is implemented with the following TDD process:

1.  `tdd-requirements.md` - Detailed requirements definition
2.  `tdd-testcases.md` - Test case creation
3.  `tdd-red.md` - Test implementation (failing)
4.  `tdd-green.md` - Minimal implementation
5.  `tdd-refactor.md` - Refactoring
6.  `tdd-verify-complete.md` - Quality confirmation

### For DIRECT Tasks

Each task is implemented with the following DIRECT process:

1.  `direct-setup.md` - Direct implementation/configuration
2.  `direct-verify.md` - Operational check/quality confirmation

```

## Confirmation After Execution

-   Check the consistency between the created tasks and the existing system with @agent-symbol-searcher.
-   Display a list of the created files.
    -   `docs/tasks/{requirement_name}-overview.md`: Overall overview and phase list
    -   `docs/tasks/{requirement_name}-phase1.md`: Phase 1 details
    -   `docs/tasks/{requirement_name}-phase2.md`: Phase 2 details
    -   (Continue according to the number of phases)
-   Display the overview and number of tasks for each phase.
-   Display the overall schedule and dependencies.
-   Report the project period and total man-hours.
-   **Display the confirmation results of existing task numbers**
    -   Used numbers extracted from existing files
    -   The number to start with for new tasks
    -   Confirmation of the assignment of consecutive numbers without duplicates
-   Display a message prompting the user to confirm the start of implementation.

## Confirmation of Links Between Files

-   Confirm that the links from overview.md to each phase*.md are set correctly.
-   Confirm that the task dependencies within each phase file are described correctly.
-   **Confirm that all task IDs are unified in the 4-digit TASK-0001 format.**
-   Confirm that milestones and phase completion criteria are clearly defined.

## Points to Note for Task Number Management

-   If there are existing files, be sure to check the used numbers with the Grep tool.
-   Supports up to 9999 tasks from TASK-0001 to TASK-9999.
-   Manage carefully to avoid duplicate or missing numbers.
-   Assign task numbers consecutively even if they span multiple phase files.
